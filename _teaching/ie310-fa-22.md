### Welcome to IE 310 (Fall 2022)! 

### ANNOUNCEMENT

### OVERVIEW
- **Pre-requisites:** Mathematical maturity at the level of a junior undergraduate student will be assumed. Prior coursework in Linear Algebra, Calculus and familiarity with Matrices is required.
- The course will introduce fundamental topics in optimization at the undergraduate level. Some specific topics to be covered are: Formulations, Linear Programming, Simplex Method, Duality, Sensitivity Analysis, Transportation, Assignment Problems, Network Optimization Problems, Integer Programs, Nonlinear Optimization, and Game Theory. 
- **Instructor:** Zikun Ye (zikunye2@illinois.edu)
- **Lectures:** Mon, Wed, Fri, 1:00-1:50pm, 2035 Campus Instructional Facility
- **Office Hour:** Fri, 4:00-5:00pm, 13 Transportation Building
- **Credit Hours:** 3 Hours
- **Teaching Assistants:** TBA
- **Textbook for reference (not required):** Introduction to Operations Research by Hillier and Lieberman (10th edition)
- **Grading Compositions:**
   * Homeworks: 40% 
   * Exam 1: 20% 
   * Exam 2: 30% 
   * In-class Quizzes: 10% 

- **Homework Policies:** 
    * Problem sets will be assigned approximately every-other-week. Homework should be submitted to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) by 11:59pm Central Time on the due date.
    * HARD deadline of **3 days** past the original due date. Late submissions after the hard deadline (penalty or not) lead to ZERO point (unless in very special cases and approved by instructor). 
    * You are given 3 **grace days** (self-granted extensions) for **the whole semester** which you can use to give yourself extra time without penalty. Note that passing the deadline by 1 minute or 23 hours are both counted as one grace day. 
    * After you have run out of grace days, all late subsequent assignments lead to **20%** of the total points of assignments.


- **Academic Integrity:** See university integrity policy [here](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/).
