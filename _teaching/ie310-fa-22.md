### Welcome to IE 310 (Fall 2022)! 


### OVERVIEW
- **Pre-requisites:** Mathematical maturity at the level of a junior undergraduate student will be assumed. Prior coursework in Linear Algebra, Calculus and familiarity with Matrices is required.
- The course will introduce fundamental topics in optimization at the undergraduate level. Some specific topics to be covered are: Formulations, Linear Programming, Simplex Method, Duality, Sensitivity Analysis, Transportation, Assignment Problems, Network Optimization Problems, Integer Programs, Nonlinear Optimization, and Game Theory. 
- **Instructor:** Zikun Ye (zikunye2 at illinois dot edu)
- **Lectures:** Mon, Wed, Fri, 1:00-1:50pm, 2035 Campus Instructional Facility
- **Office Hour:** Fri, 4:00-5:00pm, 13 Transportation Building
- **Credit Hours:** 3 Hours
- **Teaching Assistants:** 
   * Kangcheng Lin (klin14 at illinois dot edu), Tue, 12--1pm, 416 Transportation Building
   * Sondria Cottrell (bcottre2 at illinois dot edu), Thu, 1--2pm, Zoom
- **Textbook for reference (not required):** Introduction to Operations Research by Hillier and Lieberman (10th edition)
- **Grading Compositions:**
   * Homeworks: 50% 
   * Midterm exam: 15% 
   * Final exam: 20% 
   * Quizzes: 15% 
- **Course Resources:**
   * All course resources will be available in [Canvas](https://canvas.illinois.edu). See the [resource](https://online.illinois.edu/getting-started/learning-management-systems/canvas) on how to access Canvas
   * Lectures will be recorded and posted on [Media Space (channel “IE310 Fall 2022”)](https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/channel/channelid/268206292) .
   * For discussions, we will use Canvas, which is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to me, I encourage you to post your questions on Canvas. This way, the answers would benefit everyone in the class.
   * For homework submissions, we will use Canvas: https://canvas.illinois.edu.

- **Homework Policies:** 
    * Problem sets will be assigned approximately every week. Homework should be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm Central Time on the due date. Late submissions by up to **3 hours** will be accepted. After 3 hours passing the due, the submission leads to 20% **reduction** of the total points of assignments, e.g., submission with original 8/10 points is revised to 6/10.
    * HARD deadline of **3 days** past the original due date. Late submissions after the hard deadline (penalty or not) lead to **ZERO** point (unless in very special cases and approved by instructor). 
    * The **lowest** homework grade will be dropped out.

- **Course Description:** The course will introduce fundamental topics in optimization at the undergraduate level. Some speciﬁc topics to be covered are: Linear Programming, SimplexMethod, Duality, Sensitivity Analysis, Game Theory, Transportation and Assignment Problems, Network Optimization Problems, Integer Programming, Nonlinear Optimization. This is a required course in the undergraduate IE and SED program.

- **Pre-requisites:** Mathematical maturity at the level of a junior undergraduate student will be assumed. Speciﬁcally, prior coursework in Linear Algebra, Calculus and familiarity with Matrices is required, e.g., MATH 257 or MATH 415.

- **Student Learning Objectives:** Formulate mathematical models for common operations research applications, Apply common optimization algorithms for a variety of optimization problems (e.g., linear programs, network models, integer programs)

- **Academic Integrity:** See university integrity policy [here](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/).
