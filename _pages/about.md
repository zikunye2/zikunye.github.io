I am currently a PhD candidate in Operations Research at [Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ise.illinois.edu). My research focuses on data driven revenue management, and empirical operations management. For revenue management, my current research focus on online algorithms, online platform operations and the network revenue management. For empirical study, I am espescially interested in field experiment designs for online platforms such as heterogeneous treatment effects identification, and design for two side markets under the SUTVA violation.
