I am currently a PhD candidate in Operations Research at [Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://ise.illinois.edu). My research focuses on data-driven optimization, field experiments and causal inference with applications in revenue management and platform operations. I am advised by Prof. [Xin Chen](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xin-chen) and Prof. [Dennis Zhang](http://denniszhang.org).

**I will be on 2023-2024 Operations Management market.**
