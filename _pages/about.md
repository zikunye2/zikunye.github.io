Hi! I'm Zikun Ye. I am currently a PhD candidate in [Operations Research](https://ise.illinois.edu) at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), advised by [Prof. Xin Chen](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xin-chen) and [Prof. Dennis Zhang](http://denniszhang.org). I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University ([Zhiyuan College](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/en)) in 2018.

My primary research focuses on data-driven optimization and causal inference with applications in platform operations and revenue management. The goal is to provide actionable policies and operations for online platforms. Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working with [Kwai](https://www.kwai.com), [Walmart Global Tech](https://tech.walmart.com), [LIVAD](https://www.livad.stream), and [DiDi](https://web.didiglobal.com).


**I will be on the job market 2023-2024.**
