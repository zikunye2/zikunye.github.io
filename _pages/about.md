Hi! I'm Zikun Ye. I am currently an assistant professor at the University of Washington Foster School of Business in the Department of Marketing and International Business.

I received my Ph.D. in Operations Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Xin Chen](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xin-chen) and Prof. [Dennis Zhang](http://denniszhang.org). I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Engineering with Zhiyuan honors from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018. 

My research seeks to address fundamental questions under the emerging trends in technology, marketplaces, and society. I am particularly enthusiastic about developing data-driven causal inference, field experiments, machine learning, and optimization methodologies to evaluate and optimize the strategies in the contexts of digital platforms and marketplaces, especially their recommendation, advertising, and pricing policies. I’ve had the pleasure of working with platform companies, e.g., Kwai, Walmart Global Tech, DiDi, etc.

<!---My primary research focuses on data-driven optimization and causal inference with applications in platform operations and revenue management. The goal is to provide actionable policies and operations for online platforms. I’ve had the pleasure of working with platform companies including Kwai, Walmart Global Tech, LIVAD Technology, and DiDi.
