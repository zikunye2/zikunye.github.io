Hi! I'm Zikun Ye. I am currently a PhD candidate in [Operations Research](https://ise.illinois.edu) at [University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu), advised by [Prof. Xin Chen](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/xin-chen) and [Prof. Dennis Zhang](http://denniszhang.org). I earned my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018.

My research seeks to address fundamental questions under the emerging trends in technology, smarketplaces, and society. I am particularly enthusiastic about developing data-driven causal inference, field experiment, machine learning and optimization methodologies to evaluate and optimize the strategies in the contexts of digital platforms and marketplaces, especially their recommendation, advertising, and pricing policies. I’ve had the pleasure of working with platform companies including Kwai, Walmart Global Tech, LIVAD Technology, and DiDi.
